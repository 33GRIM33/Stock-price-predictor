# StockSight and Deep Learning Option Pricing

StockSight combines Indian stock forecasting with stock-specific European call pricing comparisons. The search page runs TensorFlow LSTM/GRU stock forecasts and a separate PyTorch option comparison for the searched symbol. The original synthetic benchmark remains available at `/options`.

## Stock-specific option comparison

Enter `SBIN`, `INFY`, `RELIANCE` or another supported NSE symbol on the homepage. **Generate forecast + option comparison** runs both tasks independently; **Compare options only** skips the slower stock forecast. Each option comparison trains Direct ANN, Residual ANN and Option LSTM, then compares them with Black-Scholes on identical held-out contracts. The page shows RMSE, MAE, R², premium and error graphs, a contract table and a CSV download.

The homepage uses stock-calibrated simulation automatically, with a default 5% annual interest rate and 0% dividend yield. These settings are not shown in the form. Results highlight the model with the lowest test RMSE, rank all four methods, and compare the winner with Black-Scholes. A short simulation label stays visible. The detailed methodology below documents the assumptions.

The backend supports two data modes (observed-data uploads remain available through the API):

- **Stock-calibrated simulation (default):** downloads three years of adjusted daily stock prices from Yahoo Finance. At up to 150 historical valuation dates, the preceding 126 returns calibrate an empirical-bootstrap Monte Carlo reference (1,024 paths). Returns are recentered to risk-neutral drift using the entered annual interest and dividend assumptions. Nine hypothetical calls per date use strike/spot ratios 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1 and horizons of 21, 42 and 63 trading sessions. These are simulated premiums, not exchange quotes, and the stock need not have listed options. Historical adjusted prices define the simulated spot scale. Monte Carlo standard errors are shown alongside predictions; small model differences may be sampling noise.
- **Upload observed call premiums:** supply a CSV of 60–4,000 end-of-day observations spanning at least 20 distinct valuation dates for the selected symbol. Actual uploaded premiums become the targets; there is no silent simulation fallback. Yahoo history supplies past-only volatility and LSTM features. The uploaded `spot` supplies the contemporaneous underlying price in the same units as strike and premium. The app does not independently verify uploaded quote provenance or download an NSE option archive.

Required CSV columns (a header-only template is available at `/static/option_contracts_template.csv`):

```csv
symbol,date,expiry,spot,strike,call_price
```

Use `YYYY-MM-DD` dates, rupees per share (not contract-lot totals), European calls, and one closing observation per date/expiry/strike. All symbols must match the search. Expiry must follow valuation by 1–366 days. At least 126 preceding trading sessions must be available for every valuation date. The upload limit is 2 MB. A one-day option-chain snapshot is not sufficient to train and test chronologically. Normalize provider exports to this schema first; arbitrary CSV layouts are not automatically mapped. Rates and dividend yields are constant user assumptions for the entire run (defaults 5% and 0%, not live market values); premiums outside theoretical bounds, allowing small quote-rounding tolerance, are rejected.

All contracts for a valuation date stay together in a chronological 70% training / 15% validation / 15% test split. Scalers fit training rows only, and neural networks restore their best validation checkpoint. Features use trailing 60-session annualized volatility; the LSTM also receives the preceding 20-session stock sequence. No future prices or target-derived implied volatility enter the features. Network targets are normalized by strike, and every prediction is clipped to European call bounds. Results are held-out pricing estimates using information through each valuation day's close, not future stock forecasts. Overlapping trailing histories are intentional; this is evaluation on later dates for the same stock, not a test on entirely unseen underlying assets or contract identities.

`POST /api/stock-options` accepts JSON for simulation or multipart form data for uploads: `symbol`, `mode` (`simulation`/`observed`), `rate` and `dividend` as decimal annual rates, plus `contracts` for the CSV. Results are returned to the requesting browser without overwriting the saved benchmark or sharing symbol-specific artifacts between users. The server trains at most one option model suite at a time. There is no model persistence or request cache for this feature.

## Stock forecasting dashboard

`app.py` downloads daily NSE stock prices from Yahoo Finance. Each request uses 60 trading days of Open, High, Low, Close and Volume to train TensorFlow LSTM and GRU networks that predict the next session's open and close.

Data is split chronologically: 70% training, 10% validation and 20% testing. The scaler is fitted only on training data. Early stopping and model selection use validation data; displayed test errors use the held-out test period. RMSE is in scaled units, not rupees. Predictions are converted back to rupees for the charts and forecast.

The dashboard accepts symbols such as `RELIANCE`, `TCS.NS` and `M&M`, adds `.NS` when necessary, and displays historical prices, test predictions, forecasts and company fundamentals. Unavailable fundamentals display `N/A`.

## Option pricing experiment

`train.py` generates synthetic European option contracts, adds volatility smile/skew and price noise, and compares four call pricing methods:

- Black-Scholes: the mathematical baseline using historical volatility.
- Direct ANN: a feedforward network predicting the option price.
- Residual ANN: predicts the difference between the synthetic price and Black-Scholes, then adds that correction to the baseline.
- Option LSTM: combines simulated historical sequences and contract features.

Contracts are split 70%/15%/15% for training, validation and testing. Network targets are divided by strike before standardization and multiplied by strike after prediction, so scale-free inputs can represent different contract sizes. Metrics include RMSE, MAE and R², with breakdowns for out-of-the-money, at-the-money and in-the-money calls. Lower RMSE/MAE means less pricing error.

These are simulated prices and histories, not observed market options. Strong synthetic results do not establish performance on real contracts. Live option chain downloading is not implemented. `HybridShvimerSubModel1` is an additional architecture defined in `model.py`; the training pipeline does not train it.

## Setup and run

Use Python 3.12. In PowerShell, from the project root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Internet access is required for stock data; each request trains both models and can take several minutes. Charts use native SVG, without an external JavaScript CDN.

The **View the separate saved synthetic benchmark** link opens http://127.0.0.1:5000/options.
It displays all four methods, a metric table and five downloadable comparison
graphs from `outputs/comparison`. These are independent synthetic option results,
not predictions for the stock selected on the home page. A fresh clone has no saved benchmark; generate it with the command below. The homepage's stock-specific comparison works without these saved files.

```powershell
python train.py --samples 3000 --epochs 30 --output-dir outputs/comparison
```

Run the option experiment separately (no market download needed):

```powershell
python train.py --samples 8000 --epochs 50
```

To write a fresh run without replacing previous results:

```powershell
python train.py --samples 100 --epochs 1 --output-dir outputs/smoke
```

New CLI runs save three model weight files, `preprocessing.joblib` (feature order, scalers and target normalization), metric CSVs and five plots. Old weights and metrics were produced before the normalization fix; retrain them together with the preprocessing artifact before reuse. Only load trusted pickle/joblib files. Stock-specific web comparisons train fresh models and do not reuse those saved weights.

Run all tests, including one-epoch training on synthetic/local data:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For notebooks, select the `.venv` kernel in a Jupyter-capable editor (install `ipykernel` if needed), restart the kernel and run cells in order. Notebook outputs are cleared to keep the files small; rerun cells to regenerate them. The stock notebook is a separate experiment, not the web app's evaluation implementation.

Generated caches, the entire `outputs/` directory, local screenshots and the reference PDF are ignored by Git. Keep `outputs/comparison/` locally to populate the saved benchmark page. The `.venv/` directory holds the installed dependencies; `.uv-cache/` is a disposable package download cache.

## Current limitations

- Forecast models retrain on every web request; there is no job queue or cache.
- Yahoo availability and data quality affect forecasts and fundamentals.
- The app is a local Flask demo, without production deployment infrastructure.
- Simulated option sequences do not demonstrate that real historical sequences improve pricing. Models enforce nonnegative prices, not all no-arbitrage bounds.
- Greeks require strictly positive maturity and volatility; prices support expiry and zero volatility. Implied volatility is undefined at expiry.
- This is an educational experiment, not validated investment guidance.
